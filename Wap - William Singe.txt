Look, okay

Certified freak
Seven days a week
You got that wet-wet, baby
Now my pullout game weak
Yeah-yeah (Yeah yeah, yeah hey)
I'm tryna get that wet ass pussy
Got a bucket and a mop for that wet ass pussy
I'ma give you what you want for that (Yeah yeah)

When I beat it up, I'ma get a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put that pussy on my face
Swipe my tongue like a credit card
Hop on top and just ride
Make you scream when I'm inside (Inside)
Spit in your mouth
Look in your eyes, I'ma just tie
Tie you up like you're a surprise
We can roleplay like you're mine
I'm tryna feel every detail, fuck a disguise
Neighbors callin' when you scream
Out in public, make a scene
She don't cook or clean, but she'll get this ring
Givin' life to you
Jump out 'fore I let it get inside of you
Show me where I'm 'bout to be
I'm might ride for you like you ride on me
Talk yo shit
Bite your lip while you're on this dick
She ain't gotta ask for a thing
And my mind made up 'fore I came

I go stupid for that wet ass pussy
Got a phone for the pictures of that wet ass pussy
Pay your tuition just to kiss you on that wet ass pussy
I make it rain for that wet ass pussy
